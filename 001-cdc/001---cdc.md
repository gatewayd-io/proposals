# Change Data Capture

## 1. Names

- **gatewayd-plugin-cdc**

## 2. Pitch

The proposed "CDC" plugin aims to facilitate a seamless migration process, allowing users to transition from one database instance to another with minimal disruption to production environments.

## 3. Idea

When migrating a database on production, a reasonable approach is to run another instance, synchronize it with the existing database, and have a tool in between that keeps these two databases in sync for a desired period without affecting performance considerably.

An advanced approach involves keeping databases synchronized even for direct requests, necessitating the comparison of Write-Ahead Logs (WALs) and duplicating transactions in the second database.

We want to implement this tool as a plugin of GatewayD, focusing on implementing this feature on PostgreSQL.

## 4. OSS Features

- **Compatibility:** Initially designed for PostgreSQL instances.
- **WAL Comparison:** Use Write-Ahead Logs of the source database and replicate the logs in the target database.

## 5. Paid Features

- **Compatibility:** Extend compatibility to other database pairs.
- **More Seamless:** The user only specifies the source and target database, and we will handle the rest; no need to set up Kafka or anything by the user.

## 6. Category

- Community
- Enterprise

## 7. Implementation Approaches

Based on [this article](https://medium.com/@ramesh.esl/change-data-capture-cdc-in-postgresql-7dee2d467d1b), we need to support three steps to be implemented.

1. **Capture change data**
2. **Transform change data into a format your destination database supports for upload**
3. **Upload the data to the destination database**

### Approach 1: Creating a copy of each write query inside and execute it asynchronously on the target database

In this approach, we create a database with exactly the same data as the current database, sync them, and start replicating queries from a point when both databases have the same state. Queries are queued in Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis for repeatability in case of failures.

Advantages:
- Easy to implement.

Disadvantages:
- Potential delay in syncing databases under heavy load.
- Lack of control over non-GatewayD queries, risking desync.

### Approach 2: Using PostgreSQL built-in logical replication feature for publication and subscription

Based on [this article](https://datacater.io/blog/2021-09-02/postgresql-cdc-complete-guide.html), this approach involves creating a publication on a table and a subscription to another table.

Advantages:
- Real-time event-driven capturing of data changes.
- Detection of all change event types: INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETES.
- Low impact on PostgreSQL performance.

Disadvantages:
- Not supported by very old PostgreSQL versions (older than 9.4).

Open source tools like [Debezium](https://github.com/debezium/debezium) use this feature, publishing changes to Kafka topics. Steps to use Debezium include configuring PostgreSQL, starting Kafka, starting Debezium, and implementing a Kafka consumer.

This image shows a high-level design of the system implemented in this approach.

For the subscriber/consumer part, we can try using the [Confluent PostgreSQL sink connector](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-sink.html), and if there are any problems in the scale with this connector, we can consider replacing it with our in-house consumer in the future.

## 8. Selected Approach

Considering the pros and cons of the mentioned approaches, the best approach is to use Debezium as the underlying core of CDC. Our plugin can act as a wrapper around Debezium, allowing flexibility to replace it with another tool if needed with minimal effort.

This proposal outlines the core features, implementation details, and potential paid offerings for the "CDC" plugin. The development and integration of this feature align with the goal of providing a seamless and efficient solution for database migration within the GatewayD framework.
