# Change Data Capture

## 1. Names

- **gatewayd-plugin-cdc**

## 2. Pitch

The proposed "CDC" plugin aims to facilitate a seamless migration process, allowing users to transition from one database instance to another with minimal disruption to production environments.

## 3. Idea

A reasonable approach when migrating a database on production is to run another instance, make it synced with the existing database, and have a tool in between that can keep these two databases in sync for a desired period without affecting performance considerably.

An advanced approach involves keeping databases synchronized even for direct requests, necessitating the comparison of Write-Ahead Logs (WALs) and duplicating transactions in the second database.

We want to implement the mentioned tool as a plugin of GatewayD. In this proposal, we will focus on implementing this feature on PostgresSQL.



## 4. OSS Features

- **Compatibility:** Initially designed for PostgreSQL instances.
- **WAL Comparison:** Use Write-Ahead Logs of the source database and replicate the logs in the target database.


## 5. Paid Features

- **Compatibility:** Extend compatibility to other database pairs.
- **More Seamless:** The user only specifies the source and target database, and we will do the rest, there is no need to set up Kafka or anything by the user.


## 6. Category

- Community
- Enterprise

## 7. Implementation Approaches

Based on [this article](https://medium.com/@ramesh.esl/change-data-capture-cdc-in-postgresql-7dee2d467d1b),
We need to support 3 steps to be implemented.


1. **Capture change data**
2. **Transform change data into a format your destination database supports for upload** 
3. **Upload the data to the destination database**

There are different ways to approach the implementation:

1. **Creating a copy of each write query inside, and execute it asynchronously on the target database**

    In this approach, we need to create a database with exactly the same data as the current database, and from a point that two databases are exactly having the same state, start replicating the queries.
    The queries need to be queued in Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis in order to be repeatable in case a failure happens.
    
    The advantages of this approach include:
   1. It's easy to implement as it does not need a complex understanding of the inner logic of the database.
   
   The main disadvantages of this approach include:
   1. In case there is a heavy load and data on the source database, it would be hard to reach a point where source and target have exactly the same data and start replicating queries. It's possible for the target database to be behind the source database for a considerable amount of time.
   2. In this approach, we only have control over the queries that are coming through GatewayD, in case someone makes a change to the database without using GatewayD, the source and target database will not be synced anymore and this causes issues on replicating future queries as well. Based on this, I believe that this approach is not reliable in long term and scale.
2. **Using PostgresSQL built-in logical replication feature for publication and subscription**

   Based on [this article](https://datacater.io/blog/2021-09-02/postgresql-cdc-complete-guide.html), In this approach, you can create a publication on a table of PostgresSQL using a query like this:
   
   ``CREATE PUBLICATION newpub FOR TABLE public.users;``
   then create a subscription to another table with this query:

   ```CREATE SUBSCRIPTION newsub CONNECTION 'dbname=foo host=bar user=repuser' PUBLICATION newpub;```
   Quoting the article, the advantages are:
      1. Log-based CDC enables the event-driven capturing of data changes in real-time. Downstream applications have always access to the latest data from PostgreSQL. 
      2. Log-based CDC can detect all change event types in PostgreSQL: INSERTs, UPDATEs, and DELETES. 
      3. Consuming events via logical replication boils down to directly accessing the file system, which does not impact the performance of the PostgreSQL database. 
 
   And the disadvantage is:
      1. Logical replication is not supported by very old versions of PostgreSQL (older than 9.4).

   
   There are some open source tools such as [Debezium](https://github.com/debezium/debezium) that use this feature of PostgresSQL, and publish changes to the WAL to Kafka topics, and anyone can subscribe to these topics and make the changes wherever they want.

   The steps to use Debezium are: 
   1. Configure PostgreSQL for CDC on Source:
      1. Update postgresql.conf and pg_hba.conf on the source for logical replication.
   2. Start Kafka
   3. Start Debezium and configure it to read from postgresql logs and publish them to Kafka
   4. Implement a Kafka consumer to read the data and replicate it on the target database. 
      1. We can also use some tools such as [Confluent PostgreSQL sink](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/connectors/cc-postgresql-sink.html), like what's described in [this article](https://medium.com/swlh/sync-mysql-to-postgresql-using-debezium-and-kafkaconnect-d6612489fd64) to reuse the unwrapper module that writes everything to the target PostgreSQL.  



## 8. Selected Approach

Based on the cons and pros of the mentioned approaches, I believe that the best approach is to use Debezium as the underlying core of CDC and basically our plugin can be a wrapper around it. We should still decide that whether we want the consumer to also be from Debezium or we just need the publisher. Although, the code should be written in a way that we can change Debezium with another tool if needed, with minimum effort.

This proposal outlines the core features, implementation details, and potential paid offerings for the "CDC" plugin. The development and integration of this feature align with the goal of providing a seamless and efficient solution for database migration within the GatewayD framework.
