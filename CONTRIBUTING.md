### Suggesting A New Proposal

We use GitHub issues to track proposals. If you have a proposal for a new feature or enhancement, follow these steps:

- Check the [list of open (and closed) Issues](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/proposals/issues) to see if your proposal has already been filed.
- Open an [Issue](https://github.com/gatewayd-io/proposals/issues/new).
- Explain the details of your proposal as clearly as possible. If you have a specific use case that would be better served by your proposal, include it.
- Please provide as much context as possible. If you are proposing a new feature, explain why you believe it is necessary. If you are proposing changes to an existing feature, explain how your proposal improves it.

Once it's filed:

- The project team will label the issue accordingly.
- The team will review the proposal and provide feedback.
- If the proposal is approved, the team will assign it to a team member to implement or leave it open for the community to implement. If you would like to implement the proposal yourself, please indicate this in the issue. The team will then assign the issue to you. You can then submit a pull request with your implementation.
- If the proposal is rejected, the team will explain the reason for rejection and close the issue.
